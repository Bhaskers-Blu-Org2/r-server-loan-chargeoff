There are multiple benefits for lending institutions to equip with loan chargeoff prediction data. Charging off a loan is the last resort that the bank will do on a severely delinquent loan, with the predictive data at hand, the loan officer could offer personalized incentives like lower interest rate or longer repayment period to help customers to keep making loan payments and thus prevent the loan of getting charged off. To get to this type of prediction data, often credit unions or banks manually handcraft the data based on customers' past payment history and performed simple statistical regression analysis. This method is highly subject to data compilation error and not statistically sound.
