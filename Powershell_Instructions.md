If you are configuring your own server, continue with the steps below to run the PowerShell script.


## Setup
-----------

First, make sure you have <a href="SetupSQL.html">set up your SQL Server</a>.  Then proceed with the steps below to run the solution template using the automated PowerShell files. 

## Execute PowerShell Script
----------------------------

Running this PowerShell script will create the data tables and stored procedures for the the operationalization of this solution in R in the `{{ site.db_name }}` database.  It will also execute these procedures to create full database with results of the steps  â€“ dataset creation, modeling, and scoring as described  [here](dba.html).

1. Log onto the computer that contains the SQL Server you wish to use.

1. Install [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) if it is not already present.  During the install, check the box to add LFS support.

1. Download  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/r-server-loan-chargeoff/master/Resources/ActionScripts/LoanChargeOffSetup.ps1" download>LoanChargeOffSetup.ps1</a> to your computer.

1. Open a command or PowerShell window as Administrator.

1. CD to the directory where you downloaded the above .ps1 file and execute the command:

    .\LoanChargeOffSetup.ps1

1. Make sure to accept installation of NuGet if prompted.

1. This will make the following modification to your SQL Server:
    * Installs the SQL Server PowerShell module. If this is already installed, it will update it if necessary.
    * Creates the SLQRUserGroup for running R and Python code.
    * Reconfigures SQL Server to allow running of external scripts.
    * Clones the solution code and data into the c:\Solutions\{{ site.folder_name }} directory
    * Creates the solution database `{{ site.db_name }}` and configures an ODBC connection to the database.
    * Executes the stored procedure `Initial_Run_Once_R` to run the entire workflow for this solution.

## Review Data
--------------

Once the PowerShell script has completed successfully, log into the SQL Server Management Studio to view all the datasets that have been created in the `LoanChargeOff` database. 
Hit `Refresh` if necessary.

Right click on `dbo.vw_loan_chargeoff_prediction` and select `View Top 1000 Rows` to preview the scored data.

[Click here](tables.html) to view the details all tables created in this solution.

## Visualizing Results 
---------------------

You've now  created and processed data, created models, picked the best one and used the model to predict loan chargeoff as described  [here](data-scientist.html). This PowerShell script also created the stored procedures that can be used to score new data for the new loans.  

Let's look at our current results. Proceed to <a href="Visualize_Results.html">Visualizing Results with PowerBI</a>.

## Other Steps
----------------

You've just completed the fully automated solution that simulates the data, trains and scores the models, and provide recommendations by executing PowerShell scripts.  

See the <a href="Typical.html">Typical Workflow</a> for a description of how these files were first created in R by a Data Scientist and then incorporated into the SQL stored procedures that you just deployed.
